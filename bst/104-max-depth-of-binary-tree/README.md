# 104. Max Depth Of Binary Tree

**Link**: [LeetCode - Max Depth Of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

---

## Problem
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Example
### Normal
- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: 3

### Edge
- Input: [1, null, 2]
- Output: 2

### Invalid
- Input: 
- Output:
